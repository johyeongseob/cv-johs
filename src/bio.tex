\begin{rSection}{Bio}

I am currently a masterâ€™s student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Dongguk University. I am a member of the \ac{SVM} Lab, focusing on computer vision and deep learning. My research focuses on defect classification and anomaly detection for industrial applications, aiming to solve real-world problems in automated manufacturing environments.

% The on-going project is \ac{AUV} navigation and path planning, where my research interests are in visual Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), navigation and computer vision. During B.S. and M.S. programs from Robotics Lab in Seoul National University, I also had research experience on mobile robot motion planning and dynamics/control of parallel manipulator.
